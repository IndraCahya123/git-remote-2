    <pre>
        this project will be duplicate to the other place.

        in this tutorial we will duplicate this in to github.

        how to duplicate our local project to github, first make new repo in your github account
        with the same name with your local project name.

        and do not check the initialize README and you will be redirect to the config page in github.

        so there will be several code that github provide.

        the first code is use when we doesn't have any project to duplicate.

        and the second code is use when we already have a project to duplicate to github.

        we just the first and the third line in that code. 
        (just copy that code in the git bash or command promt)

        and u have a duplicate project in your github account
